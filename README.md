MineLib.Network
===============

Library for handling network connection with Minecraft server.

My implementation of How-it-should-be.

All server and clients packets for 1.7.4 are supported.
Only logic here - automatically enable encryption. You don't need to manually handle with that.

Documentation will come soon.

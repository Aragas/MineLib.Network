MineLib.Network
===============

Library for handling network connection with Minecraft server.

My implementation of How-it-should-be.

All server and clients packets for 1.7.9 are supported.

You can use Events based packet handling (use RaisePacketHandledUnUsed() in NetworkHandler.Packets.cs) or handle dat stuff manually (use OnPacketHandled for that).

Supported:
* Yggdrasil
* Online && Pirate mode
* Nah, i think all basic stuff is supported


Documentation will come soon.
See https://github.com/Aragas/MineLib.ClientWrapper for "How use dat shiet"
